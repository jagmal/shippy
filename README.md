We are following up instructions in https://ewanvalentine.io/microservices-in-golang-part-1/ and subsequent articles to go through the process of building micro-services in GoLang.

For this process, we will be setting dev environment in Windows but deploying using docker (Linux image) on kubernetes.

Note: we are starting from scratch as previous attempt was not followed with enough attention. :)

Sequence of scripts to be run inside each folder:
--
    >.\build.bat
    >.\dockerize.bat
    >.\run.bat

    TODO: Learn ways to have targets defined in powershell script (similar to Makefile targets)
